      <strong>Roronoa Zoro</strong> (ロロノア・ゾロ, Roronoa Zoro, spelled as "Roronoa Zolo" in some English adaptations), also known as "Pirate Hunter" Zoro (海賊狩りのゾロ, Kaizoku-Gari no Zoro), is a fictional character created by Japanese manga artist <br> <br> <br>
      <hr>Eiichiro Oda who appears in the manga series and media franchise One Piece. 
      <i>He</i> first appeared in the third chapter of the One Piece manga, <sub>published</sub>  in the manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump in <sup>1997</sup>. Zoro is the first crewmate to join Monkey D. Luffy to be part of his crew of pirates, after <u>he</u> is rescued by Luffy from execution. <mark>Zoro</mark> is a highly skilled swordsman and serves as the crew's combatant,<pre>[a]</pre>though he possesses an extremely poor sense <del>of</del> direction which recurs as a running gag throughout the <center>series</center>.
